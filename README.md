# LS7366R-Breakout-Board
LS7366R Breakout Board is a quadrature counter IC board that is used to directly inferface with an encoder. It will store the counts from an encoders, like hall effect or optical encoders, and a microcontroller can recieve that information through SPI communication. This library currently works with Arduino, but there are plans to expand to more framework.

The Breakout Board used for testing is [Dual LS7366R Quadrature Encoder Buffer](https://www.superdroidrobots.com/electrical-parts/encoders-accessories/buffer-pull-up-boards/product=1523)

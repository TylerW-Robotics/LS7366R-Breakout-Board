# LS7366R-Breakout-Board
LS7366R Breakout Board is a quadrature counter IC board that is used to directly inferface with an encoder. It will store the counts from an encoders, like hall effect or optical encoders, and a microcontroller can recieve that information through SPI communication. This library currently works with Arduino, but there are plans to expand to more framework.
